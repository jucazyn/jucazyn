I’m an aspiring mathematical philosopher. My background combines Mathematics, Philosophy, and Physics, bridging the gap between logical foundations and modern applications, making me a _unicorn_ that can tackle deep conceptual and complex practical problems such as those on the frontiers of science and industry — from Physics to Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I'm studying the conditions under which two physical theories can be considered interchangeable, and the philosophical justifications for such an equivalence. This research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

**I'm open to part-time, remote opportunities**. Know more about me [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/). Please, feel free to contact me.
