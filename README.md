I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) who holds a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023). My research interests mainly center around Logic, Philosophy of Science and Physics. A notable part of the Physics-related problems that intrigues me lies at the intersection of **Mathematical Physics** and **Philosophy of Physics**. Furthermore, I've become increasingly interested in mathematical and philosophical challenges in cutting-edge **Artificial Intelligence** research.
 
Currently, I'm studying the conditions under which two theories can be considered interchangeable, and the philosophical justifications for such an equivalence. This research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

Beyond academia, my highly theoretical profile expresses itself in two ways: **technology** and **writing**. On one hand, I'm enthusiastically driven by applications involving Quantum Computing or Machine Learning, especially those where category-theoretic techniques play an important role. On the other hand, I seek to articulate what I learn into materials that may one day become blog articles or books.

**I'm open to part-time, remote opportunities**. Know more about me [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/). Feel free to contact me.
