Iâ€™m a Philosophy student at UFSC who holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023).

My current research investigates when and why two physical theories can be considered equivalent, exploring how this question informs the broader philosophical debate about the nature of scientific theories. This research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).
