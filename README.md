I’m an aspiring mathematical philosopher. My background combines Mathematics, Philosophy, and Physics, bridging the gap between **logical foundations** and **modern applications**, making me a unicorn that can tackle deep conceptual and complex practical problems such as those on the frontiers of science and industry — from Physics to Artificial Intelligence.

My current research investigates when and why two physical theories can be considered equivalent, exploring how this question informs the broader philosophical debate about the nature of science scientific theories. This research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0) at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/).

**I’m open to part-time, remote opportunities.** Feel free to contact me.
