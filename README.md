I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) who holds a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023). My research interests mainly center around Logic, Philosophy of Science and Physics. Currently, I'm studying the conditions under which two theories can be considered interchangeable, and the philosophical justifications for such an equivalence. This research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

Beyond academia, my highly theoretical profile expresses itself in two ways: **technology** and **writing**. On one hand, I'm enthusiastically driven by applications involving Quantum Physics and Artificial Intelligence, especially those where category-theoretic techniques play an important role. On the other hand, I seek to articulate what I learn into materials that may one day become blog articles or books.

**I'm open to part-time, remote opportunities**. My cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). Feel free to contact me.
